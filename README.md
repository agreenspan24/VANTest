Hello NGP VAN Reviewers on the design team,

Please take a look here at my coding test, creating front-end list and details pages.

Please note that many of these files were either auto-generated or unnecessary. The only
files necessary for the production are: 
- listPage.html
- detailsPage.html
- style.css
- main.js

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Adam Greenspan


P.S. I would like to thank Jack Dolabany, the List/Details Page master, 
who taught me the back end creation of these pages a year ago.
